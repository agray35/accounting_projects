The enclosed unadjusted TB is provided for Song Enterprises for the year ended 12/31/2017.  Using the tabs provided, prepare the company's adjusting journal entries, adjusted trial balance, financial statements (multiple-step income statement and classified balance sheet), closing entries, and post-closing trial balance.
</p>


### Rubric
<p>
	Students will be graded based on completion, accuracy, and formatting/professionalism.  			
	The use of Excel formulas and links are required.  For example, the adjusted TB should link			
	unadjusted TB amounts from the Unadjusted TB tab, and should also link to the Adjusting JE			
	tab.  Numbers should not be manually entered (hard-keyed) unless absolutely necessary.
